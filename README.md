This repository holds the code for my software engineering blog which can be found under the following domain: https://janschumann.dev/landing

I am aiming to dicuss approach to create great software faster, either by focussing on concrete technologies or discuss ways to overcome problems during the development process.

```
ng serve 
```

to run the application locally.
