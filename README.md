# Jan's Engineering Blog

This repository holds the source code for my small software engineering blog. Feel free to take a look at https://janladicha.de to see the project in action. I decided to go for a rather bare-bone Angular 18 application ready to get served on GCP's Cloud Run platform.

# Local Setup

**Step 1:** Install npm dependencies:

```
npm i
```

**Step 2:** Install the Angular CLI if not already present:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

**Step 3:** Serve the application locally by running:

```
ng serve
```
