    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/profile.jpeg" />
    <p>
      I'm Jan, working as full-stack software engineer and have collected quite
      some experience wth <span>Typescript</span>, <span>Python</span> and
      <span>Kotlin</span>. At the moment, I am particulary interested in
      <span>Angular</span>, RxJS with a neck for clean, well-tested code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I enjoy working with the web technology stack a lot, I am quite
      keen to specialize more on <span>artifial intelligence</span>,
      corresponding Python stack, especially <span>Tensorflow</span>. I'll
      compose a range of blog posts about the approaches I have taken so far
      solving problems with artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the technology, I strive for implementing elegant code, that
      is easy to understand and extend. In the end, every great piece of
      software gets written by a great team, with members that all bring in
      their unique abilities and styles. I like to learn, share and challenge
      solutions to excellent outcomes.

    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in 1993 and raised in Hörden, a tiny village in the centre of
      Germany. As there was not too much stuff to do there, I developed an
      interest in technology and coding fairly early on. After finishing high
      school, I decided to study information systems at the university of
      Münster which offered an excellent program combining elements of computer
      science and buissnes administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my bachelor's degree, I was a bit indecisive whether to
      switch to computer science or not. However, I decided to pick a rather
      unusual combination of subjects reaching deep into computer science on the
      hand and getting exposure to advanced finance topics on the other hand
      allowing me to go for a master's degree in information system. As part of
      my master's study, I got the opportunity to study abroad in the small, yet
      buitiful Kristiansand, Norway and the buzzling metropolis Madrid, Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from university in 2019 and decided to join Deutsche Bank,
      first by completing its technology trainee programm and than at associate
      engineer. Since than, I improved my software development skills
      significantly, gained experience working in a very international
      environment and contributed to a rather diverse set of applications.
