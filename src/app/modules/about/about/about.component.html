          I'm Jan, working as a full-stack software engineer, and I've collected
          quite some experience with <span>Typescript</span>,
          <span>Python</span>, and <span>Kotlin</span>. Currently, I am
          particularly focused on <span>Angular</span> and RxJS, striving for
          clean, well-tested code.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I enjoy working with the web technology stack a lot, I am
          increasingly drawn towards specializing in
          <span>artificial intelligence</span> and its corresponding Python
          stack, especially <span>Tensorflow</span>. So, you may see more posts
          forcussing on AI-related topics in the near future.

          Irrespective of the technology I work with, I strive to write elegant
          code, that is easy to understand and extend. Ultimately, every great
          piece of software gets written by a great team, with members that all
          bring in their unique abilities and styles. I am enthusiastic about
          learning, sharing, and discussing approaches to achieve outstanding
          outcomes.

        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>
          I was born in 1993 and raised in a small village in the center of
          Germany. Since there weren't many activities available, I developed an
          interest in technology and coding fairly early on. After completing
          high school, I made the decision to study information systems at the
          University of MÃ¼nster, which offered an excellent program combining
          elements of computer science and business administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following my bachelor's degree, I was a bit indecisive whether to
          switch to computer science or not. However, I ultimately chose a
          rather unconventional combination of subjects reaching deep into
          computer science on one hand and advanced finance topics on the other.
          This choice allowed me to pursue a master's degree in information
          systems while getting expose to the best of two fields. As part of my
          master's studies, I had the opportunity to study abroad in the
          charming yet modest city of Kristiansand, Norway, as well as the
          bustling metropolis of Madrid, Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed my university education in 2019 and opted to gain
          experience in the financial industry. I began with a trainee programme
          and subsequently worked as an software engineer. Since then, I've made
          significant strides in enhancing my software development skills,
          accumulated experience working in an international environment, and
          contributed to a diverse array of applications.
