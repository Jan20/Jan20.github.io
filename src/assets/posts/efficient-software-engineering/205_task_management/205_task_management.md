# Efficient Task Managemnt

Let's delve a bit deeper into managing tasks. While it may not be the most exciting aspect of software development, it is undeniably crucial for maintaining focus on essential tasks and getting things done. Our goal is to implement an unobtrusive system that seamlessly tracks all tasks, supports task prioritization, and effectively monitors their progress. Such a system can be split into three distinct parts: (1) A list serving as the home for all open tasks, (2) a form or page providing space to describe the details of tasks, and (3) finally, a set of three columns providing space for tracking the current status of tasks.

## Collecting Tasks

In theory, it seems straightforward: Every task, no matter how big or small, finds its place on a list, waiting to be addressed when the time comes. As a rule of thumb, any task requiring more than a mere two minutes to complete earns its spot on this curated list, also known as the "task backlog" or simply "backlog." We do not want to expend valuable mental energy trying to remember tasks when that mental energy could be channeled far more productively. In some way, a well-maintained backlog grants us the freedom to concentrate wholeheartedly on the task at hand rather than keeping track of the tasks to come.

## Refining Tasks

In an ideal world, each task would come neatly packaged, well-defined, and easily achievable within a matter of minutes or, at most, a couple of hours. You could effortlessly pick a task from your backlog and seamlessly move from one completion to the next. However, reality often paints a different picture, where tasks arrive with vague outlines, lacking clear definitions, or without estimated time frames for completion.

In such instances, investing time in breaking down tasks into actionable pieces becomes a crucial endeavor. The difficulty of the task becomes inconsequential as long as it is meticulously deconstructed into small, tangible actions that need to be undertaken.

By dissecting tasks into bite-sized steps, we overcome the hurdles posed by ambiguity and uncertainty. This allows us to focus our efforts on tackling one defined action at a time, progressing steadily towards task completion. The process of task breakdown empowers us to navigate even the most challenging endeavors with confidence and clarity. Remember, the key to efficient task management lies not only in compiling a comprehensive backlog but also in transforming each entry into a series of actionable steps.

## Executing Tasks

When it comes to executing tasks, it can be helpful to have a Kanban board in place to direct attention to one task at a time, conserving valuable cognitive energy. Trying to multitask often devolves into a rapid and exhausting switch between tasks, wasting energy. An effective task management system should prioritize dedicating focused attention to one and only one task at a time. There is a plethora of task management tools out there, such as Atlassian's Jira or Notion, providing everything needed to support an effective task management system.

## Further Readings

A great deal has been written about task management. However, David Allen's book, "Getting Things Done," offers a great introduction to the topic, focusing on timeless strategies.
