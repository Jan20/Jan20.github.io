# Notes from The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck

## Quotes

Happiness means to solve problems. We should make sure that we are working on problems we enjoy working on.

Having problems is a constant in life.

What pain do you want in life? What are you willing to sacrifice? What if, to what for? What is the pain you want to sustain?

Focus on simple experiences such as meeting friends, creating something or reading a good book instead of feeling that we are intitled to be special.
