# Lessons Learned

After working for well over five years as a software engineer, I‚Äôd like to share some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned over the years.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Being Efficient Matters 

Writing software comes down to turning ideas into reality, balancing speed and quality in the process. Applying a few generic strategies can help keep things moving forward.

* **Breaking up complex tasks** by defining very fine-grained, executable steps. By doing so, we can realize early on whether input from another team is required or if further clarification is needed. Of course, there is also the possibility that we simply lack knowledge of parts of the codebase or a certain technology. Nevertheless, reducing the uncertainty about a task early on is always a good starting point.

* **Eliminating inefficiencies** by removing as much manual toil as possible from the development process and reducing context switching, such as jumping between tasks or multiple applications. I always aim to have only one task in progress at a time and prefer to keep only one shell or one IDE open.

* **Automate recurrent tasks** by defining shell commands, writing scripts, extending pre-commit hooks, or adding steps to a CD/CI pipeline. My rule of thumb is that whenever I find myself repeating a task more than three times, I think about a way to automate it.

## üêö Embracing the Shell

No other program has a greater effect on a developer‚Äôs productivity than a shell like **zsh** or **bash**. To be honest, when starting out, trying to accomplish anything with the shell might seem a bit tedious, underwhelming, and strangely unpolished. Yet, after mastering some fundamental concepts, installing a few CLI tools, and learning how to chain commands together, things become much more interesting.

## üìö Keep Learning

There are constantly new technologies to learn, new concepts emerging, and only limited time available for learning. Yet, setting aside time for learning new skills is paramount, even after years of experience.
