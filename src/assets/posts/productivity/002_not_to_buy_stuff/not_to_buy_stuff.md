# Save Money

## Knowing our spendings

Personal finances have been a topic to avoid for the longest time.

Knowing how much we spend is

# Mindset

- Stop spending money on things you don't need, with money you don't have, to impress people you don't like.
- Money won't make you any happier. If you are not feeling happy right now, 1,000,000 € won't change anything about it.

- Massively lower your spendings on entertainment
- Don't get a TV or if you have one already, sell it. The same holds true for video consoles, just sell your Playstation, XBox or Nintendo's latest gaming device. Playing games alone does not make you any happier and by the way poorer, as games, session passes and in-game purchases all cost money.
- Occasionally watch a movie with friends
- Building up skills is way more valuable than playing games

- Don't ever buy a car. Go for a bike instead
- 

## Be honest with friends

## Optimize your personal finances

So when I noticed over the past few years that my fantasies had disappeared, and now I couldn’t even rake up the desire for a 2010 Prius in response to my imaginary millions, I felt a little bit empty and cheated. “What good is several more shitloads of money, if you don’t even have any desire to spend it?”, I found myself asking.

The answer was of course that when it comes to buying additional treats for myself, the extra money is in fact no good at all. And that was a very liberating thing to figure out. I have completely lost the desire for any more of the things money can buy than I already have, which means I have completely lost any form of envy, any sense of deprivation, or any sense of missing out on anything – no matter how many rap videos I watch or over-the-top houses I visit.

Your personal freedom grows with each material desire that you grow out of.

Secondly, your vehicle fleet is off-the-hook. What the hell do you need a 2009 Nissan Murano for!? Bought on CREDIT!!?? If you’re Stephen King, and your $15 million compound in Maine sits atop a 1500 foot cliff with a 45-degree rocky slope of a driveway that is snowbound for four months of the year, THEN maybe that’s a valid vehicle choice. But for the rest of us, the Murano is strictly for comedy relief, as it’s such an impractical vehicle.

If you still need to work for money, or at the very least, if you’re not saving at least 50% of your take-home pay, you can not afford it. Where “it” is anything.

“Sure Mr. Money Mustache”, some beginners will now say. “Of course you would say that, but I’m still less practiced than you. I still need my Starbucks Lattes and my husband likes TV sports so I can’t cancel cable. Can you please stop punching me in the face and let me adjust my consumption gradually instead of suddenly?”

Wrong Attitude!
