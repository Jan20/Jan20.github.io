# Healthy Routines

Having a set of healthy routines in place is crucial for living a more balanced life while achieving higher golas. Additionally, constant, positive routines can contribute greatly to a healthy state of mind. In this post, I like to share five routines that work very well for me.

## 🧘🏼Meditating

We can easily get lost in feeling stressed and surrounded by negative thoughts. In my experience, feeling constantly stressed has a massive adverse effect on what I can achieve on a given day. Thus, addressing stress and negative emotions is really important. Meditation is one way to acknowledge that negative emotions exists and to let them go. Getting started with meditation may feel like a dounting process without emidiate results. However, getting started is ultimately worth it. Taking around a quarter of an hour time of meditation right at the start of the day has proven to work best me.

## 🏃🏼Running
Sitting at a desk for at least eight hours a day has become the norm. That norm is undoubtedly harmful to the body, at least in the long run. One rather good way to mix things up a bit is to run multiple times a week. Running provides a welcomed challenge for the body while being remarkably cost efficient compared to a gym membership. I have integrated 7-10 kilometers runs into my week, prefering to kick a new week off with a pre-work run.

## 💧Drinking Plenty of Water

There is little new to say about drinking water, as water has been fuiled mankind for millennia. Even though tempting alternatives have been emerged over time, there is still nothing better than stick to water for quenching thirst. I prefer still mineral water and aim to drink at around 2.5 liters each day.

## ☕️Traking breaks

It is hard to stay all day focused. Especially after spending hours in meetings our working on demanding technical problems, taking a break, leave the desk and take a walk is paramount to replenish some mental energy. For me, not looking at any screens during breaks is really important and helps me to keep a calm mind. Usually, I go for 15 minute breaks after every 90 minutes working on a task.

## 🔅Daily highlights 

After reading the book **Make time** by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, I have started to add daily highlights to my calender. This can be anything from activities after work, meeting friends our setting time apart to work on a personal project. The most important aspect is, that a daily highlight does actually take place without compromises. It really helps if the activity is rewarding and satisfying in it self.

To sum it up, meditating🧘🏼, running🏃🏼, drinking plenty of water💧, taking breaks☕️ and establishing daily highlights🔅 can be healthly routines leading to more energy and less stress.
