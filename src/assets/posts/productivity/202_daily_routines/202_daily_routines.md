# Daily Routines
Regardless of what we pursue, having a set of highly effective routines in place is on side crucial for succeding in our endevours and on the other side to ensure that we maintain a healthy state of mind. I like to share five routines that work very well for me.

## Starting the day Meditating🧘🏽 
Depending on what we do, we can easily get lost in feeling stressed and being surrounded by negative thoughts. Based on my experience, feeling constantly stressed has a massive adverse effect on what I can achieve on a given day. Thus, addressing negative stress and negative emotions is of paramount importance. Meditation is one way to acknowledge that negative emotions exists and to let them go. Taken around a quarter of an hour time of meditation right at the start of the day works best for me. 

## Stay Hydrated💧
Getting the right supply of water is crutial for the body to perform on its highest potential. The by far best way to stay hydrated is just plain water, depending on the local water quality, still mineral water does also do the trick. I am aiming to drink at least 2.5 liters water every day and has worked out for me just fine until know.

## Running Frequently🏃🏽
As the vast majority of work is performed at a desk, which is a very unnatural position for the body, we may have the risk to harm our bodies in the longrun. Especially, the back is forced to spend a rather large amount of time in a quite stiff position. Taking a run after working has proven for me to be effective to provide my body with a welcomed challenge. Normally, I am taking runs between 6-10 kilometers depending on the day, how I feel and wheather conditions.
