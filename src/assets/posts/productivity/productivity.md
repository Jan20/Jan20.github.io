# Productivity

Much has been set about working more productive, getting things done, reaching
goals. While much of the what has been written in the productivity literature
is true, there are some patterns, that may desire a bit more attention and are
therefore outlined in the sections below.

## Not to do
Although productivity is all about getting stuff done, it is just as important
to know what not to do in order to have the time and mental capacitiy to act on
what is most crucial. Those things often tend to not being urgent, like making
investment decisions, studying and writing articles. Instead, things like going
through emails or sitting in meetings prevent us from getting the important
things done. Here is a list of the top things, not to do:
* Reading news
* Watching recommended YouTube videos
* Scrolling through social media sides
* Attend pointless meetings
* Reading too many emails
* Spend too much time playing video games

Reading or watching news is one of the worst uses of our time, as news tend to
be unidirectional, providing very little chances of engaging in a healthy
discussion. Thus, watching or reading news is a consumptive experience, that
fills our brains with a myriad of predominatly useless and more often than not
bad thoughts. Quitting to follow news enables us to think more freely and
eliviates menthal stess to some extend.

YouTube videos are one of the best sources of building-up knowledge in a
visually pleasing way. However, YouTube recommends seldom content focussing on
learning or buidling-up skill and prioritises entertaining content instead.
Therefore, it is not the best idea to follow recommended content, but rather
selecting videos individually.

Scrolling through social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok or Facebook
is a huge waste of time. The amount of content thrown upon their users is one
of the worst developments of the recent years, preoritizing emotionally engaging
content over pretty much everything causes stress and axiety. Moreover, the
widespread proliferatance of fake news can large be attributed to social media
platforms.

Attend pointless meetings is more subject of those working in traditional
company setting persuing a day job. Even though it can not always be avoided,
spending too much time in meetings has a detrimental effect on one's
productivity and job-satisfaction. Thus, keeping the number of meeting one needs
to attend to a bare minimum results in a significant increase in output.

Scrolling and reading throw emails has become the norms in the corporate world
as well as significant waste of menthal attention that could be spend on
actually getting stuff done. However, there are a few strategies for dealing
with an avalange of emails. 
1. Unsubscribe from every newsletter, second
2. Creating filters in your email application
3. Delegate email containing action items

Finally, video games have succideded movies in time spend and revenue earned in
recent years. Although virtual worlds can be captivating, spending time playing
videos games will obviously do not bring you forward in creating content or
getting done pretty much anything. Thus, my recommendation would be to sell your
video console and focus entirely on the real world.
