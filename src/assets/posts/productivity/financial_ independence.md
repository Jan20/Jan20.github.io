# Financial Independence

1. Collect information from many different soures

There is a large number of blogs and books on the topic. Therefore, I have
created a list of the blogs and resources I have found most valuable for me.

Key take aways from Mr. Money Mustache
- A very intertainingly writting blog on personal finance with the goal to retire early
- Don't spend a hundreds of dollars on leisure activities
- Do stuff that is fun that also brings you money
- Do not spend money on cable TV or nowerdays streaming services

A bit extreme when it comes to frugality, but in essence absolutely write. Especially, in regard to communiting and car ownership, the blog is brillient.
“My experience is that work becomes a lot more fun when you don’t need the paycheck. Like you I’m an engineer and I love solving the puzzles that appear in our product development lab. But I hate sitting in long meetings, making powerpoints, and taking on boring busywork– so I don’t. I’m good enough at the parts I like (perhaps only just) that I get away with it, while my colleagues who took on the commitments of a high-maintenance lifestyle basically have to eat what management dishes out.”

The mountains are amazingly beautiful. But so are so many other things, including the feeling of waking up on a Monday morning and realizing you don’t have to go to work unless you want to – today or any other day. So make your own leisure list. And share it with your fellow readers in the comments, if you like.

When you’re an alien, you can see the strangeness of a society better than its natives. And what I saw was people driving to a store, purchasing one or more plastic or polished mineral items that each represent destroying a small slice of our shared planet, and handing it to their loved ones at these pre-determined dates. Surprise! I love you! Here’s a part of the planet I wrecked for you, Hooray!!
