# Passive Learning

* There are three states: laser sharp focus on getting stuff done, complete absoption in a recreative activity and doing something that leaves 
room for listening something while doing it

* Listening to non-fictional books, like C. Martin's Clean Agile
* Listening to productivity oriented postcast, like the one from Ali Abdaal
