# Effective Task Management
Having an effective task management system in place undoubtedly helps to getting things done. But what are the characteristics of a good system? In this blog post I like to answer this question and share a few ideas I’ve learned over the years.

Before we start, let’s define a task management as the process of keeping track of tasks over there life cycle from initial definition, over planning to finalising them. It consists of a set of activities such as planning and breaking down tasks as well as a more or less sophisticated (software) system to keep track of tasks. A simple to-do list might be sufficient of keeping track of tasks while sophisticated software applications might be better suited for in some areas.

Regardless of tracking simple household chores or managing tasks for a major software project, there is a set of characteristics making a system effective.

## Task tracking 

A task management system is effective if it decreases the time needed to achieve a goal.

From my experience, an effective system is first and foremost good tracking <strong>all tasks</strong> regardless of there importance.  Everything taking longer than two minutes to performs gets tracked and receives a place in a backlog. It’s an idea that sounds rather trivial but we are rather bad at keeping tasks in our heads. It costs a certain amount of mental processing power to remember tasks, that can be used more effectively.

## Break down of tasks into actionable pieces

In an ideal world, every task should be clearly defined, actionable and small enough to be performed in a matter of minutes or at most two hours. It should be possible to take a task from the backlog and complete one task after another. However, in the real world, tasks get often only loosely defined or without establishing an estimate of how long it may take to perform it.

Thus, a rather great deal of time may be dedicated to breaking down tasks into actionable pieces. It is not important, how difficult a tasks, as long as it is broken down into small pieces of concrete actions that need to be taken.

## Fostering to work sequentially

Multitasking has been proven to be quite ineffective. Performing two cognitive demanding tasks such as implementing a complex software feature and answering emails at the same time is simply not possible. In reality, multitasking is more often a rapid switch between tasking  wasting cognitive energy. Thus, an effective task management system should only allow one task to be in progress at a given time.

However, there is one noteworthy exception to the rule: It is actually perfectly possible to perform a cognitive undemanding tasks such as performing household chores and listening to content such as audiobooks or podcasts at the same time. The retention rate of the contained information might suffer, yet be a better use of otherwise lost time.

## Visualizing Tasks

In addition, an effective system should visualise what needs to be done to always have a precise view on what has been done, what tasks are in process and what task need to be performed. A simple to-do list might not be the right instrument to provide the best possible visualisation. Personally, I prefer a kanban board as offered in a wide range of software tools such as Atlassian’s JIRA application. 

JIRA, offering a web-based kanban board combined with a decent mobile application is my preferred way to keep my tasks organised. However, I like to be rather agnostic when it comes to software applications for organising tasks. It has something very motivating to see tasks moved from the backlog quickly to being done.

In the end, a piece of paper can do the job just as well as the most sophisticated software application, if all tasks get tracked and get broken down into actionable pieces.

## Recap

1. An effective task management system should:
2. Track all tasks regardless of their importance
3. Break down larger tasks into actionable pieces
4. Makes tasks visible
5. Enforces to work sequentially

## Further Readings
A lot has been written about managing tasks. My approach has been heavily influenced by David Allen's book Getting Things Done that describes a lot of useful concepts and can definitely recommend the book.
