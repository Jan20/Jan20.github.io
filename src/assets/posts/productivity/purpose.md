# Purpose of the Blog

The internet is one of the best inventions ever. It gave billions of people access to free information and the opportunity to share their ideas, opinions and believes. It was designed to be open for everyone and tried everyone
equally. However, recently some of the freedom it provides got misused to
spread lies, fake news and political propaganda. Personally, I think it is
time to take use the internet again in its intended way: Share free
information, saying the truth and teach skills.

## Angular
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed
by Google in colaboration with a wide community. I am using Angular on a
daily bases and like to share some best-practices or solutions that have just
worked well for me.

## Personal Finance for Developers
Next to writing about Angular, I am most passioned about diggiing deeper into personal finance with a slightly more technical twist than normally seen on the internet.

## Recommendations
Over the time, I have read quite a bit and like to share some of the most useful blogs, books and articles.

## Well-Being
Although most content will be on Angular, Machine Learning and personal finance there might also be some articles focused on living a better life
in terms of becoming healthier and reduce stress.
