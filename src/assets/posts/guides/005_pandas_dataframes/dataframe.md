# Pandas Datafames
The following post provides an introduction to Pandas dataframes.

## Definition
A dataframe is 2-dimensional, labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. Thus, it is well-suited to store time series data, where the first column may represent dates over time, while all other colums contain some values like temperatures measured on the dates provided in the first column.

## Application
Although dataframe can certainly be used to store weather information, they are also well-suited to store stock market data. Let's assume an example where the <code>date</code> column stores a period of traiding dates and a second column <code>AAPL</code> contains the close price of an Apple stock at the end of a traiding day.
