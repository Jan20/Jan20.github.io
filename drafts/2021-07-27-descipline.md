# Discipline & Habits
Building up strong habits is key for building up long-term success!ðŸ¥‡ Only through performing tasks frequently we can expect to become any better. However, finding the motivation to stand up and excersising instead of relaxing is challenging. I like to share some tips building up the discipline needed to accomplish our goals.ðŸ˜‰

independent. They try out new business ideas, invest or plans to create passive
income streams.

They have in common that achieving desired outcomes require work, which is not

overcome obstacles requires discipline, that is the skill to direct ones mind
to pursue a goal.
