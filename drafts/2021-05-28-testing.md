# Why Mock?
Why should we use a mock instead of a real service object in a test?
Imagine the service implementation above has a dependency to a database or some other third-party system. We don’t want to have our test run against the database. If the database isn’t available, the test will fail even though our system under test might be completely bug-free. The more dependencies we add in a test, the more reasons a test has to fail. And most of those reasons will be the wrong ones. If we use a mock instead, we can mock all those potential failures away.
Aside from reducing failures, mocking also reduces our tests’ complexity and thus saves us some effort. It takes a lot of boilerplate code to set up a whole network of correctly-initialized objects to be used in a test. Using mocks, we only have to “instantiate” one mock instead of a whole rat-tail of objects the real object might need to be instantiated.
In summary, we want to move from a potentially complex, slow, and flaky integration test towards a simple, fast, and reliable unit test.
So, in a test of our SendMoneyController above, instead of a real instance of SendMoneyUseCase, we want to use a mock with the same interface whose behavior we can control as needed in the test.
