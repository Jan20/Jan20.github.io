# Mind

Comparisons are killers of joy. Whenever comparing ourselves with others on
income, possessions or anything, there is a very high chance for encountering
unsatisfaction. Instead of feeling happy for the other person, it is very easy
to ask ourself why the other person has a larger car, higher income or the
fanciest new phone.
Avoiding the virtically expension of our reference group.
