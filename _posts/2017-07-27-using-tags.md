# Discipline & Habits
Building up strong habits is key for building up long-term success. 
Performing tasks over and over again makes one getting continously in
what one is doing.
Some may choose to dedicate their time to create pieces of art. They train their
skills by spending thousands of hours working ever better painting, scultures or
novels.
Others are more interested in obtaining wealth, becoming financially independent.
They try out new business ideas, invest or plans to create passive income streams.

They have in common that achieving desired outcomes require work, which is not
always a pleasent experiences. Going through rough time, to persevier and
overcome obstacles requires discipline, that is the skill to direct ones mind to
pursue a goal.
